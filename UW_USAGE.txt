This software will extract mean FA values for each subject in a TBSS dataset.


Before using, please ensure that:

1. DTI data for all subjects has been preprocessed (all steps below should be complete):
	a. Converted to NIFTI
	b. Skull-stripped
	c. Corrected for motion and eddy current-induced distortions
	d. Tensor fit to produce FA image
	e. QA checks of SNR and motion to ensure subject meets criteria for inclusion

2. All images that passed QA check have been added to TBSS directory (preferably with [SubjectID]_FA.nii.gz name)

3. The run_ENIGMA_ROI_ALL_script.sh script has been edited and saved:
	a. PROJECT_DIR and DTI_DIR likely will need to be changed
	b. The pattern for subject files may need to be edited also


To run the ROI analyses:
1. bash /mnt/stressdevlab/scripts/ROI/enigma/run_ENIGMA_ROI_ALL_script.sh
